# Testing

- Introduction
    - Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that the software product is Defect free.
    - It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest.
    - The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.
- Why Software Testing is Important?
    - Software Testing is Important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product.
    - Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
- What are the benefits of Software Testing?
    - **Cost-Effective:** It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs less to fix.
    - **Security:** It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier.
    - **Product quality:** It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is delivered to customers.
    - **Customer Satisfaction:** The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX Testing ensures the best user experience.
- Types of Software Testing
    - Manual testing
        - Black Box Testing
            - Definition
                - Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester
            - Functional Testing
                - Definition
                    - This black box testing type is related to the functional requirements of a system; it is done by software testers.
                - Unit Testing
                    - Definition
                        - This software testing basic approach is followed by the programmer to test the unit of the program. It helps developers to know whether the individual unit of the code is working properly or not.
                - Integration Testing
                    - Definition
                        - It focuses on the construction and design of the software. You need to see that the integrated units are working without errors or not.
                    - Approaches
                        - Big Bang Approach
                        - Incremental Approach
                            - Top Down Approach
                            - Bottom Up Approach
                            - Sandwich Approach - Combination of Top Down and Bottom Up
                - System Testing
                    - Definition
                        - In this method, your software is compiled as a whole and then tested as a whole. This testing strategy checks the functionality, security, portability, amongst others.
                - UAT ( User Acceptance Testing)
                    - Alpha
                    - Beta
                    - Gamma
            - Non-Functional Testing or Performance Testing
                - Definition
                    
                    This type of black-box testing is not related to testing of specific functionality, but non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, usability.
                    
                - Performance Testing
                - Endurance
                - Load Testing
                - Volume Testing
                - Scalability Testing
                - Usability Testing
                - Stress Testing
                - Failover Testing
                - Security Testing
                - Compatibility Testing
            - Maintenance
                - Definition
                    
                    Regression Testing is done after code fixes, upgrades or any other system maintenance to check the new code has not affected the existing code.
                    
                - Regression
        - White Box Testing
            - Definition
                - White Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester.
            - Path Testing
            - Loop Testing
            - Condition testing
        - Gray Box Testing
    - Automation testing
